## What is this?
This project is an experiment. The idea of this project was that I wanted to create a program that has the ability to read the words in the pictures, sorta like OCR. In this particular example I was building a very serious and useful application – a meme reader.
You can see it live [here](https://owlypixel.github.io/Meme_reader/) on GitHub pages.
